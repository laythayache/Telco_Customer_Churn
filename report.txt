Executive Summary
We analyzed 7,043 telecom customers across 20 features to understand drivers of churn (~26% churn rate) and establish a baseline performance. Key predictors include tenure, contract type, service offerings (e.g., fiber vs. DSL), payment method, and monthly charges. A naive “always-stay” baseline achieves ~73% accuracy but catches zero churners, highlighting the need for an imbalance-aware model.

1. Data Overview
Size & Shape: 7,043 records × 21 columns (prior to encoding) analysis.

Feature Types: 4 numeric (SeniorCitizen, tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) and 17 categorical (e.g., gender, Contract, PaymentMethod) analysis.

2. Missing Data
Only TotalCharges had 11 missing values (0.16% of rows), imputed with its median. All other fields were complete analysis.

3. Data Cleaning & Encoding
Dropped customerID (no predictive value).

Converted TotalCharges to numeric and imputed.

Binary target Churn mapped to 0/1.

One-hot encoded all 17 categorical features, resulting in a high-dimensional feature space (many dummies) analysis.

Scaled all numeric features to mean 0, std 1 via StandardScaler analysis.

4. Class Imbalance
Stayed (0): 5,174 customers (73.5%)

Churned (1): 1,869 customers (26.5%)

Imbalance ratio ~3:1 analysis.

A naive DummyClassifier that always predicts “Stayed” achieves 73.4% accuracy but 0% recall on churners analysis.

5. Feature Distributions
Numeric:

tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, and SeniorCitizen all exhibit varied spreads and some skew (e.g. tenure skewed toward low values) analysis.

Categorical:

Most customers have phone service, multiple internet options (Fiber, DSL, None), and varying contract lengths. Some dummy columns (e.g. no-phone-service) are rare (<10% of data) analysis.

6. Churn vs. Features
6.1 Numeric Insights
Tenure: Non-churners have much higher tenure (mean +0.21 vs. –0.59 standardized).

MonthlyCharges: Churners pay more (mean +0.28 vs. –0.11 standardized).

TotalCharges: Higher for stayers.

SeniorCitizen: Slightly more churn among seniors analysis.

6.2 Categorical Insights
Contract: Two-year contracts have ~3% churn vs. ~44% for month-to-month.

InternetService: Fiber optic users churn at ~42% vs. ~15% for DSL.

PaymentMethod: Electronic check users churn ~45% vs. ~11% for automatic payments.

PaperlessBilling also correlates positively with churn analysis.

7. Correlation Analysis
Top positive corr with Churn:

InternetService_Fiber optic (r ≈ +0.31)

PaymentMethod_Electronic check (r ≈ +0.30)

MonthlyCharges (r ≈ +0.19)

PaperlessBilling (r ≈ +0.19)

Top negative corr:

tenure (r ≈ –0.35)

Contract_Two year (r ≈ –0.30)

TotalCharges (r ≈ –0.20) analysis.

Multicollinearity note: MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges correlate ~0.65; consider dropping or regularizing one to avoid redundancy.

8. Baseline Performance
A DummyClassifier (always “Stayed”):

Confusion matrix:
[[TN=1035, FP=0],
 [FN=374,  TP=0]]
Accuracy: 1035/1409 ≈ 73.4%

Churn recall: 0% analysis.

This sets the minimum bar: any real model must both exceed 73.4% accuracy and start identifying churners (TP > 0, FN ↓).
